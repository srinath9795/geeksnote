# geeksnote


Geeks way of taking notes.

This extension is used to take quick notes related to any GFG problem you saw or solved so that you can refer back later. All the notes are automatically saved.

It also helps you to write down a concise solution to the problem so that you need not read the whole page again when referring to it again.

You can browse through all the notes across different pages in a dedicated view for easy access.


UPDATE :  geeksNote now works on codeforces.com also.

You can install this extension from [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/geeksnote/madmdfkpjojhbedohmenmgpedfdgbfio?hl=en).

It would be great if you can pitch in to improve the design of the allNotes page which shows all the notes. Any other contributions are welcome too â˜º
